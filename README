This is the YAML data file for http://londonbookshops.org/

Pull requests welcome!

Charity shops are included only if they specialise in books (or in
e.g. books and music).

Photos need to be on Flickr and under a Creative Commons licence.  You
just need to give the URL of the photo page and everything else
(licence, copyright owner, date taken) will be worked out automagically.

The code doesn't use all the fields yet.  In particular, the locales
field is not yet in use, but please feel free to populate it anyway.

Possible fields documented in fields.txt.

Any other questions, email me at kake@earth.li
